We’re excited to announce that we’ll be launching our new podcast, **Smarter Together**, very soon!

The show will be hosted by our wonderful volunteers — _Jamie Rimby_, licensed professional counselor and parent of a K-12 student, and _Jen Lindell_, real estate loan portfolio manager and travel enthusiast. Each episode will be featuring exclusive conversations with educationists, industry professionals and our dedicated team of volunteers, as they discuss their journey, inspiration, how software has impacted their lives and what keeps them up at night.
