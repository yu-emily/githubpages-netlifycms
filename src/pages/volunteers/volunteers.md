## Volunteering

### We are grateful to our growing number of dedicated volunteers; therefore, we are recognizing them.

#### How does it feel to volunteer for The Programming Foundation?

> I worked with The Programming Foundation for a little over a month and, I was impressed by the volunteer team and staff. Everyone was knowledgeable and had a great attitude toward the work and goals of The Programming Foundation. Volunteering with TPF was a fun and interesting way to work with others remotely during COVID-19 while honing my talents as a Social Media Manager.
