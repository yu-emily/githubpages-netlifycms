Storing raw content right in the static site repository is an ideal approach, allowing both code and content to be versioned together, but that requires non-technical editors to interact with a service like GitHub. Netlify CMS was created specifically to bridge this gap, providing a solid interface that works well for technical and non-technical users alike, and interacts with your static site repository via API so that every change results in a commit.</p>\n<p>A primary focus of Netlify CMS is to work well with modern site generators like Gatsby. Installation typically requires just an index.html file and a YAML configuration file, but you’re going to leverage the Gatsby plugin for Netlify CMS to automatically install and build the CMS along with a static site.</p>","frontmatter":{"feature_image":{"publicURL":"/githubpages-netlifycms/static/e6374ec99433de68cf734ef12f64d219/netlifycms.png"},"title":"NetlifyCMS","alt_text":"NetlifyCMS logo","image":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-01-26-netlifycms/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-01-26-netlifycms/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-12-28","title":"Where there is a will…","template":"post-template"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-12-28-wherethereisawill-thereisaway/"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
