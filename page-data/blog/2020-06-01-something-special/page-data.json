The education sector is dealing with the future generation and the current crisis and e-learning gained importance than classroom learning.</p>\n<p>The Programming Foundation commits to spreading awareness and education on computer programming and operating systems so that everyone is involved, and no one is left behind while the world advances. The world has benefited from open-source and now it is the time to harness its power for the betterment of the future. At The Programming Foundation, we are in the initial stage of developing an operating system with a simple interface that runs on the open instruction set architecture, RISC-V.</p>\n<p>We are trying to provide this ecosystem for students from low-income families to enable themselves to educate in much-needed programming skills and the foundations of operating systems. We have taken the cause of building an operating system based on FreeBSD. After our third fundraiser, we plan on manufacturing these low-cost devices. We’ll raise funds and work with other nonprofits and schools to empower students in several parts of the US, and India. Eventually, we plan on doing the same in South East Asia, and Africa. This will not only help us build smarter us but also democratize the adoption of RISC-V processors.</p>\n<p>The following demo is running on the x64 architecture:</p>\n<p>The current situation has created an opportunity for us to be kind, generous, and compassionate for our future generation. We’re trying to lay the foundation stones for a smarter us. To support this mission, we’ll require a substantial amount of resources along with volunteers. This will enable us to create a new era of education for our present and future generations.</p>\n<p>To learn more about RISC-V, visit: <a href=\"https://riscv.org/\">https://riscv.org/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"feature_image":{"publicURL":"/githubpages-netlifycms/static/7d3e8a5bc029ed7bf384ca59719a3f60/c350ff87-d13e-420a-8b35-23f417b61abf.png"},"title":"We’re working on something special","alt_text":"the programming foundation with RISC-V logo","image":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-01-something-special/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-01-something-special/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-08","title":"We’re now a member of CSforALL","template":"post-template"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-05-08-member-csforall/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-01","title":"Thank you, Google!","template":"post-template"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-01-thankyou-google/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"]}
